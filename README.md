## Hello World, it's me Samantha! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an economist turned tech enthusiast, combining my love for business and technology. With a solid background in finance and tech, Iâ€™ve worked in investor data management and contract validation, ensuring precision and efficiency.

After moving from Brazil to Europe, I spent 7 years honing my skills in customer service and tech licensing. Now, after 1500 hours of intensive web development study at Trybe, Iâ€™m a passionate developer who thrives on turning ideas into innovative, clean, and efficient codeâ€”whether it's front-end with React or back-end with Node.js and SQL.
